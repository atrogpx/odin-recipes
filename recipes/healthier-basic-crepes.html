<h2>Description</h2>
<p>I love this recipe because it is so simple to make. I have made it healthier by substituting whole wheat flour and 1% milk. I like to fill them with non-fat plain Greek yogurt and blueberries warmed in maple syrup. Yum!</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup white whole wheat flour</li>
    <li>2 eggs</li>
    <li>½ cup low-fat (1%) milk</li>
    <li>½ cup water</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    <li>½ cup non-fat plain Greek yogurt</li>
    <li>¼ cup maple syrup</li>
    <li>½ cup blueberries</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Whisk together flour and eggs in a large mixing bowl. Gradually add milk and water, stirring to combine. Mix in butter and salt and beat until smooth.</li>
    <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop 1/4 cup batter onto griddle. Tilt pan with a circular motion so batter coats the surface evenly.</li>
    <li>Cook crepe until bottom is light brown, about 2 minutes. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook other side. Serve hot with yogurt, maple syrup, and blueberries.</li>
